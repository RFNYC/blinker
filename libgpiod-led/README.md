# libgpiod OUTPUT example: LED

This file explains how to build a line request and push voltage to **three LEDs**. It should compile on a Linux based system if there is GPIO (like the RPI4). This code makes use of GPIO Pins 18, 24, 25 (BCM) but you can put your own values to test it with your circuit.

## Build
```
make
```

## Execute

```
./led-example
```

## Clean
```
make clean
```
