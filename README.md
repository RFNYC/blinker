# C++ libgpiod examples

This repo is intended to show how to use [libgpiod](https://libgpiod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) in C++. I found resources on how to use the library in C but there aren't many on using it in C++ so I hope to build up this repo to help my own understanding and help out others.

# Examples
1. libgpiod-led: Output to 3 LEDs.
2. libgpiod-Sensor: Output to active buzzer and LED via sensor input.

## Other
Inspired by [starnight's repo](https://github.com/starnight/libgpiod-example?tab=readme-ov-file) with libgpiod examples for C.
