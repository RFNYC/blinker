# libgpiod OUTPUT example: LED

This application turns an LED on and off twice with 3 seconds in between. Should compile on a Linux based system if there is GPIO. (like the RPI4)
The code makes use of GPIO pin 18 (BCM) but you can put your own values to test it with your circuit.

## Build
```
make
```

## Execute

```
./led-example
```

## Clean
```
make clean
```
